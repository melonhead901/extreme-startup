# The Problem

You are building a system for the very supersticious CEO of a drone delivery company, John. Last week John phoned up one of his small customers, Anna, to try and sell her some more drone deliveries. To his amazement Anna increased her order of scheduled drone deliveries by over 9000!

Given this, John is sure that there are more customers out there just like Anna. He's also sure that it must be something to do with the fact that Anna's name is a palindrome. Given this, he wants a report including all the phone numbers for any current customer whose name is a palindrome.

Get to it beaten down IT contractor!

## Guidelines

0. You should not need to edit any classes in the `cannot.touch` package. Everything else is fair game
0. The docker tests are slower than normal unit tests, slow tests are bad, so don't test there what you could test elsewhere.
0. You'll want to use mocking.
0. The first docker test and unit tests have been written for you.

## Getting Started
0. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview)
1. `./gradlew idea` or `./gradlew eclipse`
2. `open *.ipr`
3. Run the tests!
